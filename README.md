# [Advent of Code 2023](https://adventofcode.com/2023)
My solutions to the advent of code 2023

## Q/A:
- **Why PHP ?**  
  It's one of the languages I know the best for rapid scripting.  
  (compiling takes time I could use to solve the puzzle)


- **The code doesn't look optimized and/or maintainable.**  
  True, however that wasn't the goal: These scripts are made
  to solve one and only one issue as fast as possible. And so the time
  spent on making clean code is used instead on solving the puzzle.


- **Are you on the leaderboard?**  
  Probably not. But my goal is primarily to use the puzzles as 
  logic training. I do try to solve them on the same day as they come out.
  but I mostly start in the evening, so around 7 to 11 hours after
  the new puzzles are announced.


- **Can I copy your solutions?**  
  I would say **NO**: the challenge is to try the puzzles for yourself.
  However, the code is available, and I can't stop you.


- **Can't someone use your solutions to get on the leaderboard?**  
  They can't, no matter how fast I'll solve the puzzles, 
  I won't make my solutions available until the leaderboard is already full.


- **Where can I try the puzzles?**  
  You can go to the [website](https://adventofcode.com/2023).
  ~~Or for each day there is a ``input.txt`` with the input file I got, and a 
  ``results.txt`` with the results the scripts should give 
  (each line is the result for one part) in the ``data`` folder.
  Also on each day is a ``README.md`` with the context and on each part a
  ``README.md`` with the puzzle.~~ 
  [PSA: Don't share your inputs](https://www.reddit.com/r/adventofcode/comments/18an94z/psa_dont_share_your_inputs_even_in_your_github/)


- **Did you upload the input files/questions?**  
  I did... Now they should be private and not visible anymore. I think they
  should be allowed inside the repo, but I don't make the rules.

- **I have a question on one of your solutions, how do I ask for more information?**  
  Just open an 
  [Issue](https://github.com/TomKauffeld/advent-of-code-2023/issues/new?assignees=TomKauffeld&labels=documentation%2C+QA&projects=&template=question-on-a-solution.md&title=%5BQA%5D+%7Bday%7D+-+%7Bpart%7D+-+%7Bsummary%7D) 
  using the ``Question on a solution`` template.
  Information needed: the ``day`` and ``part`` number + a small oneliner 
  in the title. I'll be happy to respond :)


- **I have a question, but not specific to one solution**  
  Same as above, just open an
  [Issue](https://github.com/TomKauffeld/advent-of-code-2023/issues/new?assignees=TomKauffeld&labels=documentation%2C+QA&projects=&template=question-on-a-solution.md&title=%5BQA%5D+generic+-+%7Bsummary%7D) 
  but instead of ``{day} - {part}`` just put ``generic``.
