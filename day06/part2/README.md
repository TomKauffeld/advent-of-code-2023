# [Advent of Code 2023](../../README.md) - [Day 6](../README.md) - Part 2

Just like [Part 1](../part1/README.md), bruteforced my way through.  
The execution time wasn't event that long.

Compared to yesterday with [Day 5 - Part 2](../../day05/part2/README.md)
where I spend 4 hours, this one was solvable during a coffee break.
